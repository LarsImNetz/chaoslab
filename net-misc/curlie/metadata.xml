		If you like the interface of HTTPie but miss the features
		of curl, curlie is what you are searching for. Curlie is
		a frontend to curl that adds the ease of use of httpie,
		without compromising on features and performance. All curl
		options are exposed with syntax sugar and output formatting
		inspired from httpie.
