		Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor
		from SSLMate that alerts you when a SSL/TLS certificate
		is issued for one of your domains. Cert Spotter is easier
		than other open source CT monitors, since it does not require
		a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
		certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.
