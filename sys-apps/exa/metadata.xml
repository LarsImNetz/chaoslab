	<longdescription lang="en">
		exa is a modern replacement for ls. It uses colours for
		information by default, helping you distinguish between
		many types of files, such as whether you are the owner,
		or in the owning group. It also has extra features not
		present in the original ls, such as viewing the Git status
		for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree
		view. exa is written in Rust, so itâ€™s small, fast, and portable.
