ChaosLab: Overlay for Gentoo Linux
----------------------------------

![packages 182](https://img.shields.io/badge/packages-182-yellow.svg?style=flat-square)
![ebuilds 238](https://img.shields.io/badge/ebuilds-238-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

The scope of this overlay is to host ebuilds for packages related to secure communication,
cryptocurrency, server-side applications, and many other things that I'm interested in. It
also include full support for `libressl` USE flag and **OpenRC**. You can visit a
[user-friendly](LISTING.md) list of packages, where I hope that you find something useful.

**If you find any bugs, please report them!** You can use the
[GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/chaoslab/chaoslab-overlay/issues) to report bugs, ask
questions or suggest new features. I am also happy to accept merge requests from anyone. If you
prefer private communication, feel free to contact by [e-mail](overlay.xml#L9)
([PGP Public Key](#signature)).

**DISCLAIMER:** As I don't have the resources, nor the time to make stable ebuilds
in the same way Gentoo developers do, all ebuilds are permanently kept in the _testing
branch¹_. Thus, you should probably consider it to be _unsafe_ and treat it as such.
Nevertheless, I try my best to follow Gentoo's QA standards and keep everything up to date,
as I use many of these packages in a production environment.

> ¹ *If a package is in testing, it means that the developers feel that it is functional,
but has not been thoroughly tested. Users using the testing branch might very well be the
first to discover a bug in the package in which case they should file a bug report to let
the developers know about it.* —

## How to install the overlay
You can clone the repository and create `/etc/portage/repos.conf/chaoslab.conf` with the
following contents:

```ini
[chaoslab]
priority = 50
location = /path/to/local/chaoslab-overlay
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://gitlab.com/chaoslab/chaoslab-overlay.git
auto-sync = Yes
```

> **Note:** I recommend that you manually install the overlay, as obviously you will be
pulling directly from the original source. If you use the automatic installation described
below, you will be pulling from [gentoo-mirror](https://github.com/gentoo-mirror)'s
service, in which from time to time have [sync issues](https://bugs.gentoo.org/653472).

Alternatively, for automatic install, you must have
[`app-eselect/eselect-repository`](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-eselect/eselect-repository)
or [`app-portage/layman`](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-portage/layman)
installed on your system for this to work.

#### With `eselect-repository`:
```
eselect repository enable chaoslab
```

#### With `layman`:
```
layman -fa chaoslab
```

> **Note:** To use the testing branch for particular packages, you must add the package
category and name (e.g., foo-bar/xyz) in `/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords`. It is
also possible to create a directory (with the same name) and list the package in the
files under that directory. Please see the [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild_repository)
for an expanded overview of ebuilds and unofficial repositories for Gentoo.
