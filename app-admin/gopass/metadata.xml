		gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager
		in Go with the aim of making it cross-platform and
		adding additional features. The target audience are
		professional developers and sysadmins (and especially
		teams of those) who are well versed with a command
		line interface. One explicit goal for this project is
		to make it more approachable to non-technical users.
