		Gollum is an n:m multiplexer that gathers messages
		from different sources and broadcasts them to a set
		of destinations.

		Gollum originally started as a tool to MUL-tiplex LOG-files
		(read it backwards to get the name). It quickly evolved to
		a one-way router for all kinds of messages, not limited to
		just logs. Gollum is written in Go to make it scalable and
		easy to extend without the need to use a scripting language.
